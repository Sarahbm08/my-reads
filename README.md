Sarah Morley's MyReads App
===============================

This is Sarah Morley's implementation of the MyReads app for the udacity Front End Web Development nandegree.

## How to Run

This app utilzes the React framework, so in order to run you need to run `npm install` then `npm start` to start the server. A browser window will automatically open with the MyReads app running.

## Features

The MyReads app is to organize your reading habits. There are three "bookshelves" where you can place your books: 

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

## Searching and Adding

This way you can keep track of the books you are reading, want to read, or have already read. You can also add more books by clicking on the green plus button on the bottom right corner. This brings you to the search page where you can search for books that fit various categories. To add a book to your bookshelves, simply click on the down arrow next to the book and select the desired bookshelf. When you navigate back to the main page that book will now appear in the chosen bookshelf.

## Removing Books

To remove a book, select "None" when choosing a bookshelf and it will be removed. You can then add it again by using searching and selecting a new bookshelf.
